## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for dropping in.  
This repo is my handsâ€‘on playground for the **Python Crash Course** curriculumâ€”each commit tracks a new concept Iâ€™ve just learned. Feel free to explore the code, open issues, or share ideas; collaborative learning makes the journey way more fun!

Happy learning! ðŸš€
